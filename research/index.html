<p>The opioid crisis is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and trillions of dollars in costs. The secondary market for opioids contributes substantially to those numbers. While shutting down the secondary market can alleviate the health threat induced by the drug diversions, it could also trigger increased unnecessary prescriptions, leaving the welfare consequences of closing secondary market distribution ambiguous. Drawing on Schnellâ€™s (2017) model of secondary markets and the opioid crisis, we design a laboratory experiment to investigate the effect of secondary markets on patient and physician behaviors. We find that, as compared to when the secondary market is absent, in the presence of a secondary market patients visit physicians more frequently and physicians provide more prescriptions. Consequently, we find that shutting down this distribution channel reduces total consumption of opioids, and positively impacts overall health outcomes. Our results provide clear evidence that policies aimed at restricting secondary markets would significantly contribute to mitigating the opioid crisis.</p>

<p>Quotas and Opioid Crisis: An Experimental Analysis (with <a href="https://economics.gmu.edu/people/dhouser">Daniel Houser</a>, <a href="https://www.en.empwi.econ.uni-muenchen.de/team/professor/winter/index.html">Joachim Winter</a>)</p>
<p>The opioid crisis is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and trillions of dollars in costs. Over-availability and over-accessibility of opioids due to the over prescription of physicians contribute substantially to those numbers. In response to the current trend of decreasing prescriptions each year, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has embarked on a campaign to reduce the Aggregate Production Quota. However, the way behaviors of physicians and patients might change with reduced quotas remains unclear. Drawing on Schnell&rsquo;s (2017) model of secondary markets and based upon our previous findings of over prescriptions when the secondary market is present (Deng and Houser, 2021), we design a laboratory experiment to investigate how the quotas affect patient and physician behaviors. We find that when quotas are present, patients visit physicians less frequently and physicians become stricter in prescribing than in the absence of quotas. Consequently, we find that introducing quotas reduces total consumption of opioids, and positively impacts overall health outcomes. Our results provide rigorous evidence that quota policies aimed at reducing the total supply can contribute significantly to mitigating the opioid crisis.</p>
